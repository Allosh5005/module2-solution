			<h3 class="title">Chicken</h3>
			<p>At our resturant we promise to always serve our guests the best tasting food. From our award-winning chicken to our tender, fall-off-the-bone baby back ribs. In our restaurants, you can watch your food being cooked from start to finish. Because our kitchen is right in front, you can follow your food to your table. Our time-tested recipes have been handed down through the generations, from our handmade coleslaw to our English style cod. At Chicken Shack, we believe the small things we do make a big difference.

			<h3 class="title">beef</h3>
			<p>great burgers are key.  Our namesake Beefing technique— Beefing up a fresh, never frozen, juicy patty on a hot seasoned grill—results in a delicious burger that stands alone in taste, texture, and juiciness. Add butter-toasted artisan buns, real cheeses, freshly chopped produce, and robust sauces, and you’ve got a burger with no comparison!
			Our recipes range from traditional to food-forward, with modern takes for those looking to discover new burger tastes.  Our menu variety continues with beef, chicken, bison, black bean and more!
