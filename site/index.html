			<h3 class="title">Chicken</h3>
			<p>At our resturant we promise to always serve our guests the best tasting food. From our award-winning chicken to our tender, fall-off-the-bone baby back ribs. In our restaurants, you can watch your food being cooked from start to finish. Because our kitchen is right in front, you can follow your food to your table.

			<h3 class="title">Fish</h3>
			<p>Our menu is inspired by classic Japanese traditions evoking the chef’s memories of home cooked meals with items suitable for any time of the day and for every palate.
			CT has the freshest fish this side of the shoreline, any way you want it … raw or cooked.

			<h3 class="title">beef</h3>
			<p>great burgers are key.  Our namesake Beefing technique— Beefing up a fresh, never frozen, juicy patty on a hot seasoned grill—results in a delicious burger that stands alone in taste, texture, and juiciness. Add butter-toasted artisan buns, real cheeses, freshly chopped produce, and robust sauces, and you’ve got a burger with no comparison!
